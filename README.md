# Lecture Notes for the course Structured Prediction and Optimization IFT6132-H2019 

This repo is to be used for both the tex source files and the compiled pdfs
of the scribed notes for the class. Please put all the files relevant
to only one lecture in a directory called lec{#} (source tex but also bib
files and images). I have created a preamble containing package includes,
commands and shortcuts, it automatically adds the scribe_MG. The corresponding
sty file needs to be findable by your latex compiler. 
In the gitignore are specified most latex compilation auxilary files
so as to not pollute the repo. 

Feel free to open an issue if you have any trouble with the repo or have some 
questions.
